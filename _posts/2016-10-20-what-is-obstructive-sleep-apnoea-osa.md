  What is Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA)?
publisher: {}
description: >+

  There are two types of breathing interruption characteristic of OSA:


  apnoea – where the muscles and soft tissues in the throat relax and collapse
  sufficiently to cause a total blockage of the airway; it's called an apnoea
  when the airflow is blocked for 10 seconds or more


  hypopnoea – a partial blockage of the airway that results in an airflow
  reduction of greater than 50% for 10 seconds or more


  People with OSA may experience repeated episodes of apnoea and hypopnoea
  throughout the night. These events may occur around once every one or two
  minutes in severe cases.


  As many people with OSA experience episodes of both apnoea and hypopnoea,
  doctors sometimes refer to the condition as obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea
  syndrome, or OSAHS.


  The term "obstructive" distinguishes OSA from rarer forms of sleep apnoea,
  such as central sleep apnoea, which is caused by the brain not sending signals
  to the breathing muscles during sleep.
